# perfect-market-external-factor-calculations-in-python
A program that calculates the  impact of introducing external factors such as taxes, price ceilings and price floors does to a perfect supply and demand market 

## Getting started 

Code  calculates  the impact of 3 external market factors 
* Taxes
* Price ceiling
* Price floor 

Use whichever is preferred  

Run the blocks of code corresponding  each of the external factors.
Some blocks of code will prompt for user input: Provide the inputs required when prompted- these are the  variables of  the demand and supply curves and the value of the market factor e.g tax value.

Final Output for each factor will provide  a  solution to the impact in terms of :
* Consumer surplus 
* Producer  surplus 
* Deadweight loss , etc 


## Prerequisites

* Jupyter notebook  
* numpy
* Ipython
